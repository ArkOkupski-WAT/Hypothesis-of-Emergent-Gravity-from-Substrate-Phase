## Overview

This repository contains the formal manuscript for the **Hypothesis of Emergent Gravity from Substrate Phase**, a theoretical framework proposing that spacetime and matter are different phase states of a fundamental entity called the **Substrate**. In this model, gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent phenomenon arising from the thermodynamic relaxation of excited Substrate states (matter) back to their ground state.

The hypothesis offers a unified approach to addressing gravity, dark matter, and dark energy through a single, dimensionally consistent mathematical formalism.

## Key Features

-   **Unified Description:** Matter is modeled as metastable solitonic configurations (`ψ ≈ 1`) in the Substrate, while spacetime is its ground state (`ψ ≈ 0`).
-   **Emergent Gravity:** Gravitational attraction is explained as the macroscopic effect of the local relaxation process of these solitons.
-   **Mathematical Consistency:** The model is built on a variationally principled action, ensuring dimensional consistency and strict adherence to local energy-momentum conservation.
-   **Testable Predictions:** The framework predicts the existence of a new massive scalar particle (a quantum of the ψ-field) and suggests variable gravitational effects in regions of intense matter-phase transitions.
